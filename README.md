# Hupl
Short for Http UPLoad (imaginative, I know)

This is a simple Android app, that lets you upload files to a server via HTTP POST through the share menu. 
You can configure whatever, and how many servers you want, and of course feel free to just use the preconfigured one(s).
Any webserver, that accepts a file via POST and spits out a link to the file afterwards should work.

For hosting your own server, please have a look at https://github.com/Rj48/single_php_filehost (or roll your own, it's not exactly rocketsurgery)


# Building
This repo contains an Android Studio (v2) project. You should be able to open it with that and just run/compile from there.
